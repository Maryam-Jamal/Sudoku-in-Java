# Sudoku-in-Java
This project is a simple Sudoku solver implemented in Java using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes a 9x9 Sudoku grid with some pre-filled values (represented as zeros for empty cells) and finds a valid solution by filling in the empty cells. The solver checks each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid to ensure that the numbers 1-9 appear only once.

Features:
- Solves any 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking
- Checks for the validity of the solution by ensuring unique numbers in each row, column, and sub-grid
- Prints the solved Sudoku grid or notifies if no solution exists
  
How to Run:
1- Clone the repository.
2- Compile the Sudoku.java file.
3- Run the compiled Java program to see the solved Sudoku grid.
